ungreg the greg

custom hotbar - mode where hands unlinked
maybe shift chest positioning shenanigans into metaGUI itself

Stardust UI rumblings 2024 {
    paneLayer="hud", dismissable=false
    
    custom full UI since displayRegisteredPane exists to do the buttons' job
    autohide stuff??
    custom layout - theme dependent? configurable??
    
    radial menu on holding r - doing what? do we want to venture away from the vanilla essential slot setup??
    
    - - -
    
    create a functional inventory replacement first!!
    can puppet around a {0, 0} sized inventory pane as an origin for openWithInventory panes
    
    - fake tabfield that doesn't swap?? and just changes the bag that the item grid is representing
    
    - need to figure out how to tell (with accuracy) what container the player has open...
    - since we're OSB, we could do it a messy hacky way, monkey patching ALL container pane configs to hook in
    
    x { type=portrait scale=1.5 renderHumanoid=true }
    - got the portrait working via canvas though
    
    - will want pane position memory as part of metagui
    - hm. probably tab memory for the session
    
    - action bar link follow!
    
    - equipment slots
    - stats
    - trash slot
    - pixels/currency
    hotbar slot indicator
    sort button
    techs?
    pet stats??
    
    AUGMENT APPLICATION!!!
    wait, how do you even do that???
    ah, it runs kind of sort of a build script
    I guess do some dirty synchronous pane init hackery
    
    armor slot glyphs
    burn sfx on overwriting an item in trash slot
    right-click equipment on?
    
    update rate optimizations
    - item grid doesn't work if it scrolls??? wasn't consuming event
    
    toggle: auto tab switch
    
    - fix broken container switch
    - try to fix it disappearing for a frame whenever you switch containers
    eventually, figure out the smol oddness with nanofield head/leg slots
    costumes still display base body for some reason
    
    !!! closeWithInventory=false on chest ui!!
    maybe that should be default with metaGUI???
}

- force recoverability for metaGUI panes

add integration info to startech part of readme (generators, autosmelter)

    table layout?? or some manner of syncing label widths
    
    layout variables!! {
        dictionary in stuff, address variables by string "@@varname"
        "$$varname"?
        any type, not copied if a table (so you can technically pass an empty table to something for it to use as a shared pool/handle)

    style value that doesn't call decorate
    shouldDrawFrame I guess??
        
    findWindowPosition shortcut for anchored windows
    use input table for cursor position where available for added stability?
    
    player-local "clipboard" support that gets used if there's no extension
    
    OSB button sound path
}

hm... codex tracking I guess

HUD Manager {
    - eventhook library
    refactor current HUD stuff into hudmanager using said eventhook
    
    figure out how to handle extensibility?
    
    do the marking thing in pulseweapon too
}

> Beta v0.1.6 {
    
    LOAD ON DEMAND FOR TERMINAL
    ^ keep visible item slot rows only
    
    implement container hooking for update limiting

} big things to do by Milestone 2 {
    !!! metaGUI passive keysub {
        can focus canvas then delete to capture without intercepting (FROM OTHER GAMEPLAY)
        this will still block input to other panes!!
        share passive keysub between all panes, whether requesting or not
        notify all panes when click focus changed?? need to pass escape event to active pane!
        
        UI flag to only spawn if something needs it so as to prevent unnecessary input blocking for other things
    }
    
    THREAT GENERATION SYSTEM {

    X metaGUI shift+click item tracking { shift clicking doesn't pick up from inventory with no container open >:|
        keep track of cursor item every frame
        store tracking globally
        bookkeeping function as part of mg
    }
    
    attempt to provide non-StarExtensions multi-wheel
    
    text box selections
    (adjust cut/copy/paste!)
    multiline text boxes?
    
    eliminate ninepatch overlapping when too small (clamp areas to half render size)
    
    stock icon system w/ manifest so themes can override
    
    metaGUI-powered docs system
    
    store multiple EPPs within augpack for quick swapping
    
    option to always show beacon and enemy radar (deployment)
    
    add some logging stuff to drive rectification
    
} and unspecified {
    modules system for nanofield so other mods can add their own things
    
    nanofield stats to implement {
        - powerCapacity
        - elytra damage bonus
        
        elytra boost speed multiplier?
    }
    
    visual effects status for essentia booster?
    
    toggle nodes (use canDeselect)
    probably show item costs regardless of whether you have a path to a node
    maybe also fixed costs
    
    reset catalyst (how should this work...?)
    
    probably some refund of AP from already-catalyst'd items?
    
    better power generation, especially when Fenthes are considered
    have batteries tick slower when not at full utilization
    
    maybe revamp drive bay to use checkSync

the BIG IDEA UPDATE {
    backend stuff {
        ? metaGUI module system (requires some slight reworks) {
            container layout, immediately containing module UI
            script loaded just before containing UI
            ... nesting?
            need to make it possible for named stuff to place its proxy elsewhere...?
            actually, needs to be basically a widget subclass in order to have multiple of the same module?
        }
        
        maybe some way to plonk widgets into the title bar
        particularly, a function to turn the icon into an item slot
        
        channeled universal communications {
            explicit join protocol
            
            public (msg board) and direct message queues
            distinction between pub and all
            
            abstract into event based things?
            packet types of join, leave, update and message
            
            public and connection datastores
            pub can be pathed-updated
            
            
            
            query as array
        }
    }
    dialogue tree system {
        metagui, fixed window; can intercept escape due to how keyboard capture works
        dialogue is just lua coroutines
        informal function call syntax makes a lot of sense for this
        "accumulator" with active word wrap, processed on addition?
        choice system, responds both to mouse and keyboard; option to have last choice as "default no" (escape)
        letter-by-letter display is just part of the coroutine workings
        customizable name heading, portrait display, talkboops
        automatic paging
        by default, automatic spacing between puts ("word array"-ish mechanics)
        all spacing and newlines autocollapsed to a single space; explicit newline tag
        specialized wait command that skips over if in "rush mode" {
            triggered by hitting escape during display *or* at page wait
            instant display until page
        }
    }
    complete pulse equipment rework {
        reset catalyst refunds everything invested into an item's progression
        is AP gifting a bug or a feature?
        
        maybe heat rises faster when pulling against gravity in elytra?
        
        swappable spheres
    }
    eidolon hunting {
        something you can build at endgame to enable queuing (within the same map)? can build lobbies on mp servers
        huge, ancient crystalline constructs, maybe Aetheri-related?
        scales independently of tier system, drops a lot of AP and components for things (Kinetic Field Cores anyone?)
        unlimited elytra flight in atmosphere gated behind your first few eidolons (or at least someone's)
    }
    more pulse weapons! {
        warblades
        pulse rifle
        shardstorm
        flux knives
        pulse chakram similar to razorwave
    }
}

old - for (maybe not) next update {
    ...
} then {
    give the glaive a light source paired with energy
    
    proper tool tip for fp-containing objects
    
} then {
    customizable elements for pulse weapons (via configurator)
    give Pulsestrike Glaive a secondary that isn't just the combo finisher
    maybe an alt finisher to main fire combo if buffered during?
    rework phase drill to be tiered and also maybe a dynitem
}

? hook engine {
    included by replaced util.lua
    hijacks the first setting of _ENV.init to hook into core tables (widget, player etc.)
}

! TRADING SYSTEM {
    part of stardustlib; basically Path of Exile's trade UI
    quickbar button puts an item in cursor; clicking on a player prompts them to accept/reject trade, via playerext
    right click dismisses without trading, and emits a sound effect to the player (might need UI shenanigans for local sfx?)
    cursor item should make it look like a trade-icon cursor, if that's achievable
    on (unexpected) uninit, spawn a stagehand at player position that lasts for ~.5sec and deletes cursor item from anywhere it can find
    (consume item drops, consume from containers within reach, consume from player inventory)
}

sb.jsonQuery exists, adjust itemutil.property?

turn the liquid accumulator (phase drill, excavate) into a prefab

configurable tram stop {
  built-in player sensor
}

reserve material ID range somewhere
semigloss black hull panel

x BYOS functionality as machine { // probably incompatible with FU's version
    damageTileArea with ridiculously high strength and harvest level and radius big enough to cover a t8 vanilla ship from one end, in both fg and bg
    itemDropQuery and collect into database
    upgrade player ship to custom tier to get rid of bg image and collision material
    force-kill objects set "residual" by Hacking them and using object.smash
}
patch warp state matching into encounter variations of booster flames (/objects/ship/boosters/)
add distinguishing names to even/odd small booster flames
lots of shiny new ship components, especially animating ones that match their state to flight {
    warp cores should count as FU ones, if possible
}

move tag patches to stardustlib and add some more {
    "component", "material" etc.
}

power stuffs {
    Resonite Reactor!
    
    fluxsaber - fluxpulse-charged beamsword, high combo potential especially when wearing nanofield or other control tech
    pulse rifle - hitscan machine gun with shotgun secondary
    vector rifle - railgun sniper with mechanics similar to Splatoon's chargers or Warframe's Ferrox
    artemis bow - bouncy ray a la the shadowbeam staff from Terraria
    
    powered lamp that fills a large region with full-bright light (basically volumetric lighting at the cost of fp)
    ^ local animator.
    
    more smelter-type machines
    ^ chance bias stat (inverse exponent to random number)
    
    prefix and move power categories to stardustlib?
    
    eventually make transmatter network require power (after rewrite)
    ^ why? just because AE did it??
}

compost bin that makes food age faster, for use as biofuel
^ some sort of powered processor to make (liquid) biodiesel?

renamer (custom shortdescription, put vanilla one as category because tooltip)

some item transport for automation (and library to make use of input/output configuration)
networked wire I/O ports

metaGUI {
    
    eventually {
        icon support for buttons
        debug console pane via common-table
        rework preferredSize to take both a width and a height?
        keyboard layouts...
        
        it's technically possible to use metatable shenanigans to have the pane script survive a f8 reload?
    }
    
}

ipc lib {
    weakly-keyed by _ENV for automatic cleanup
}

Extend sync library {
    //Recognize RpcPromise returning another RpcPromise and replace in queue
    
    actually, response system with a proper response-message instead of just an RpcPromise
    generate responseID with makeuuid? register with an anonymous function for continuation of operation after response
    
    coroutine-based things? ...
    
    fixed sync registry (register callback ahead of time; optional automatic timer)
}

Fenthes species {
    base spritework on updated Zia costume
    
    starts with nanofield w/ rcs pack (damaged?) and choice of pulse weapon (a la pokemon starters)
    
    doesn't interact with vanilla story because was never a Protector
    intro scenario {
        starts on a shared ship on an asteroid mining mission
        interact with weapon rack to pick starter weapon
        ship is destroyed by a Leviathan-type Eidolon en route to target
        player must navigate a debris field via rcs pack to get to a workable engine, fighting off Eidolon-spawn in the process
        ends up on essentially a debris platform with an engine strapped on as your starting ship (native BYOS)
    }
}

Aetheri species mod {
    
    Androgynous, fullbright "core" (novakid male minus chest definition, with Avian-ish talons) with crystalline plates on top
    (part of innate armor); hue and brightness sliders for core, fine-grained control over what plates you have
    
    AP sharing?
    "aether channeling" for particular weapon types (back up energy bar using aether when wielding specific weapon types)
    
    figure out crit conditions for innates other than sniper
    actually put crit multiplier somewhere on the tree
    crit rate (multiplier on base chance, bonus timing length etc.)
    
    make flight in air use aether; place behind unlock, add efficiency stat
    
    Innates {
        ! standardize on a separate tag (energyColor?) for replace directives
        
        Kinetic Burst {
            refine secondary, place after unlock?
            different secondary in water and zero-g?
        }
        Sniper Shot {
            give it a final name!
            figure out a secondary; overheat shot?
        }
        Shatterflurry? Shredflurry? rapid fire spread salvo similar to Terraria's Crystal Storm
        Fireball
        Charge Cannon (roughly mega man X style; secondary could be a melee attack?)
        PUNCHY PUNCH
        Shield Spheres {
            kind of like magnorbs meets Mega Man shield weapons (or Mei's tears from that BoI:A+ mod)
            primary to fire them off, secondary to make them spin faster and deflect projectiles
            maybe always active with knockback but not damage? takes yeeting them off to actually dps
        }
        Artemis Bow - both single (piercing?) and spread shots
        Shatterpulse - wide radial pulse that cuts armor down but doesn't do much damage
    }
    
    Skill tree {
        "node keys" (catalysts?) dropped rarely by mobs depending on level, used as gate costs
        use a vault key to gate off some lategame clusters
        item for refunding nodes (stone of reattunement?)
    }
    
    Hunger system {
        Stat locked so that food doesn't replenish; instead, it's based on exposure to the stars
        Regenerates in about a minute when exposed to sun or starlight; 2-3x faster while on ship
    }
}
